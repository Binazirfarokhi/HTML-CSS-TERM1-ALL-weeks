Font Family

For paragraph text, use a font that is easy to read; serif and sans-serif fonts are often a good choice. Display and handwriting fonts are usually better for heagings. Try to use no more than two or three font families on a page.

It is unlikely that the default browser font family will be the best choice for your design; avoid using it.


Line Length

Estimates for the ideal line length vary; I recommend between 50 and 75 characters. Line length can be adjusted by changing the font size, paragraph width, etc.

Text that is left-aligned is easier to read. Centered text should only be used for short sections of text or headings.


Typographic Hierarchy

Use larger text to call attention to headings and indicate the order of importance and structure of the document.


Line Height

Successive lines of text should not be too close together or far apart; experiment with different line height values to find the value that is easiest to read for a given font. A good starting place is often line-height: 1.5.
